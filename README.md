## Technical Details

### Metadata Management

In Next.js, you can manage metadata using various conventions, including `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, and layout metadata in `layout.tsx`. This allows you to define how your application interacts with search engines and social media platforms. For more details, refer to the [Next.js Metadata Documentation][Next.js Metadata Documentation].

### Open Graph Image Generation

To optimize social media image generation, you can use the Vercel `@vercel/og` library. This library allows you to create dynamic Open Graph images using HTML and CSS, which can enhance how your content appears on social media platforms. For more information, check the [Open Graph Image Generation Documentation][Open Graph Image Generation Documentation].
